Hi Reader!

Here goes my second fully-functional HTML, CSS, JavaScript based website.
Etch-a-Sketch has been the highlight of my childhood, and it was great recreating it on my handy machine.
While I can feel JS getting harder with each passing project, completing a project makes the trouble worth the while.
My tip to newcomers would be to ease into the language slowly, as it is quite different from C/C++, which most of us are familiar with.

Feel free to check this project out [here](https://g-aditi.github.io/etch-a-sketch/)!
